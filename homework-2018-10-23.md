Domain model:
* package
* class Person
* class Company
* interface / abstract class (that the classes above extend)
* age (integer)


Ceremonies:
* Entry point class (main method)

Implementation:
* Using lambda
    * populate person & company instances (generating number of age automatically)
    * assign them to type-safe collection(s)

<i>Bonus:</i>:
* implement helper class (utility class), that implements Comparator by (both domain classes) age
* sort the collection(s)
* print result to standard output
